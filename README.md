# FusionUtils
Some utils including a shell script to remove all Fusion folders

- RemoveFusionFiles

This can be used for doing a clean uninstall - i.e. once you uninstalled fusion remove all the additional folder and files from your Mac

You probably need to run it with the sudo option in the Terminal so it has all necessary privileges:

sudo sh RemoveFusionFiles.sh
